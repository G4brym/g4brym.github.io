      <description>1. Project Information&amp;rsquo;s I was contracted during my first year in an under graduation, to automate problems and speed up processes inside a local logistics company.
The main problem the company had was that every waybill ever handled by them was in a single excel file with thousands of excel functions and automation. And because they were just a local company, that meant that they had to integrate with other bigger logistics companies, that sent them every morning what packages they were sending and where does packages needed to be at the end of the day.</description>

      <description>1. Project Information&amp;rsquo;s This project was an online database, where anyone could search for Portuguese companies through various ways, including related companies by activities.
This was a side project developed only for personal use. As it was beginning to get indexed by Google it started receiving a lot of daily people searching for companies.
This project was later shutdown and now it is available on Github.
The source code for this project doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any information&amp;rsquo;s about the companies, you have to get it however you want and add it to the database by yourself.</description>
