      <description>1. Project Information&amp;rsquo;s This project was an online database, where anyone could search for Portuguese companies through various ways, including related companies by activities.
This was a side project developed only for personal use. As it was beginning to get indexed by Google it started receiving a lot of daily people searching for companies.
This project was later shutdown and now it is available on Github.
The source code for this project doesn&amp;rsquo;t include any information&amp;rsquo;s about the companies, you have to get it however you want and add it to the database by yourself.</description>
